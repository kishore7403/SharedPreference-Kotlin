# Android HR Preferences App

## Project Description

This Android application is designed for the HR department to efficiently manage employee preferences. The app allows employees to input their personal information, including name, age, gender, date of birth, and department. The preferences are stored using SharedPreferences, ensuring data persistence even after the app is closed and reopened.

## Key Features

- **Data Persistence**: SharedPreferences are used to save and retrieve user preferences, ensuring that employee choices are retained across app sessions.

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to enhance the user experience and gracefully handle unexpected scenarios, including validation messages for input fields.

## How to Use

1. Install the app on an Android device or emulator.

2. Fill in the employee preferences, including name, age, gender, date of birth, and department.

3. Ensure valid input for each field, with appropriate validation messages for errors.

4. Click the "Save Preferences" button to store the preferences.

5. The saved preferences will be automatically loaded when you reopen the app.
